# Frank's guide for CS24 project 1: Atomic Expressions

## Brief summary:

There are a total of 8 files for this project. We have three important classes to work:

1. node (from `node.h`)
2. list (from `list.h`)
3. expression (from `expression.h`)

All three of these classes work together to convert an atomic expression i.e $(x+3)$
